Python scripts to sign AWS API queries

For most users, sending requests to the AWS APIs is much easier to do with the AWS CLI or the different SDKs. However, there are some edge cases where you want to test a feature that has not been implemented in your client of choice. Or maybe you just want to sign a request URL and send it to AWS to see what happens.

These tools allow you to do so.
